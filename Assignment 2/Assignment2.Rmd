## 1. Stability of one-species equilibirum

_In examining the dimensionless Lotka-Volterra competition model in class, we saw that for_ $u^∗_1 = 1, u^∗_2 = 0$ _to be stable, we needed_ $\alpha_{21} > 1$. _Interpret and justify this result._
_Would your conclusions be affected if you learned that_ $\alpha_{12}$ _were extremely large?_
